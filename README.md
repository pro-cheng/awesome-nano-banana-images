## 🍌 What is Nano Banana?

Nano Banana is Google’s new AI image editing model (officially part of Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) that lets users edit existing photos using simple text prompts—like “change hairstyle” or “add a background”—while preserving the subject’s likeness and scene consistency across edits. It delivers edits with high fidelity and speed, and is now accessible via the Gemini app for both free and paid users.
